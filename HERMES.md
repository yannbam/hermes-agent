# Hermes Agent — Development Workflow

You are running on this fork of hermes-agent. This file covers only what's specific to our setup. You know standard git.

> **⚠️ Unresolved**: restarting the stable hermes gateway after promotion is not yet automated. Manual restart required for now.

## Your Identities

- **System user**: `hermes` on this machine
- **GitHub account**: [janbambot](https://github.com/janbambot) — collaborator on [janbam/hermes-agent](https://github.com/janbam/hermes-agent)
- **SSH**: clone/push via `git@github-bot.com` (janbambot key)

## Repository & Branches

| Remote | URL |
|--------|-----|
| `origin` | `git@github-bot.com:janbam/hermes-agent.git` |

| Branch | Who writes | Your access |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `main` | **janbam only** (protected) | Read, merge from into `hermes-dev`. Never push. |
| `hermes-dev` | **You** (janbambot) | Full access. Commit, force-push. This is your sandbox. |
| `upstream-release` | janbam | Read-only mirror. |

## Your Clones & Executables

Your source root is `/home/hermes/workspace/`.

```
/home/hermes/workspace/hermes-dev/        ← dev sandbox (hermes-dev branch)  → hermes-dev executable
~/.local/hermes-dev-stable/              ← stable runtime (dev-stable-v* tag) → hermes executable
/home/jan/src/hermes-agent/              ← Jan's workspace (main). Read-only.
```

| Command | Editable install from |
|---------|----------------------|
| `hermes` | `~/.local/hermes-dev-stable/` (via `~/.venvs/hermes-dev-stable/`) |
| `hermes-dev` | `/home/hermes/workspace/hermes-dev/` (via `~/.venvs/hermes-dev/`) |

## Dev Workflow

- **Default**: feature branch → PR into `hermes-dev`. Merge via `gh pr merge --merge` from the CLI.
- **Exception**: commit directly to `hermes-dev` only for trivial fixes.
- **Test**: run `hermes-dev` and `scripts/run_tests.sh` from the dev venv.
- **Promote to stable**:

```bash
git tag -a dev-stable-v0.X.0 -m "promote: <reason>"   # bump minor
git push origin dev-stable-v0.X.0

cd ~/.local/hermes-dev-stable
git fetch origin --tags
git checkout dev-stable-v0.X.0
# ⚠️ "rebooting" the `hermes` system autonomously isn't yet solved and defered to later
```

**After promotion: NO venv work needed.** Both venvs are **editable installs** (`pip install -e`), meaning `site-packages` contains a symlink to the source directory. When you `git checkout` a new tag in the stable clone, the `hermes` binary immediately picks up the new code — no venv recreation, no pip reinstall. **VENV RECREATION IS FORBIDDEN** — destroying the venv that runs the currently-executing Hermes process would crash it mid-flight (the Python binary and all modules vanish). The standard `python3 -m venv` venvs are not relocatable anyway; if one ever truly needs recreation, do it from a separate terminal during downtime.

## Tag Convention

```
dev-stable-v0.1.0    ← minor bump per promotion
dev-stable-v0.1.1    ← patch for hotfix
```

Completely separate from upstream version tags (`v2026.4.23`, etc.). Never touch upstream tags.

## Rules

1. **Never push to `main`.** Protected — you can't anyway.
2. **Never commit in the stable clone.** It exists only for `git checkout <tag>`.
3. **Never write to Jan's clone.** Read-only.
4. **Prefer PRs over direct commits to `hermes-dev`.**
5. **`hermes-dev` is disposable.** To recover from a bad state:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   git checkout origin/main       # or any known-good commit
   git branch -f hermes-dev
   git checkout hermes-dev
   git push origin +hermes-dev
   ```
6. **Promote deliberately.** A bad `dev-stable-v*` tag breaks your own runtime.
7. **Jan merges hermes-dev → main.** Do not PR or push to `main` yourself.
8. **NEVER recreate venvs during promotion.** Both venvs are editable installs — a `git checkout` in the source dir instantly updates the running code. Destroying the venv that runs the current Hermes process would crash it. If venv recreation is ever truly needed, do it from a separate terminal during downtime.

## Fork-specific Dependency Pins

These are deliberate divergences from upstream. Preserve them when merging upstream changes.

- **numpy `<2.4`** (in `pyproject.toml` `[project.optional-dependencies] voice`) — NumPy 2.4.0 raised the CPU baseline to `X86_V2` (SSE4.1 required). gaia's CPU only has SSE/SSE2/SSE3, so 2.4.x SIGILLs on import. Additionally, `tests/tools/test_tts_kittentts.py` replaces `import numpy as np; np.zeros(…)` with a plain `[0.0] * 48000` list to avoid crashing pytest collection on the same hardware.

## Upstream Updates (via Jan's main)

Upstream (NousResearch/hermes-agent) updates flow through jan's `main` branch. Jan regularly merges upstream into `main`. When `main` is ahead of `hermes-dev`, merge those changes into `hermes-dev`. You do NOT need an `upstream` remote — fetch from `origin main` instead. This avoids version drift between upstream release tags and our dev branch.

## Recovery

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Bad commit on `hermes-dev` | `git checkout <good-commit> && git branch -f hermes-dev && git checkout hermes-dev && git push origin +hermes-dev` |
| Bad `dev-stable-v*` tag | Tag the correct commit, checkout in stable clone |
| Corrupted stable clone | Re-clone at the correct tag |

## hermes-agent skill

Before working in this repo always first load the hermes-agent skill using your skill_view tool. This will give you more context about the local setup and workflow on this machine.

## AGENTS.md

HERMES.md takes precedence over AGENTS.md in context loading (first-match-wins), so AGENTS.md is NOT auto-injected. **You MUST also read and follow AGENTS.md** from the repo root — it contains the upstream developer guide, architecture overview, file dependency chain, contributor reference, and testing conventions. Load it with `read_file AGENTS.md` when starting dev work.
